## Welcome to zero_escape_jb01

The purpose of this project is to re-create to the best of our ability the Rhizome 9 location from the Japanese-developed game, "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward" as a map for Garry's Mod - particularly for use in the Jailbreak gamemode.

This map tries to stick to **the original game's material** as much as possible; and features minimal artistic interpretations; only enough to make it an enjoyable Jailbreak experience.
