## Welcome to zero_escape_jb01

The purpose of this project is to re-create to the best of our ability the "Rhizome 9" location from the Japanese-developed game, "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward" as a map for Garry's Mod - particularly for use in the Jailbreak gamemode.

The core geometry of the map is **designed to replicate the game's original artistic intent and design**; though we have opted to add, remove, or modify features and locations to make the map ultimately better suited for the Jailbreak gamemode.

## Map Features

- Support for up to 32 prisoners.
- Fully featured and designed two story prison map based on the "Rhizome 9" location from Virtue's Last Reward.
