## Welcome to "Zero_Escape_JB01"

The purpose of this project is to re-create to the best of our ability the "Rhizome 9" location from the Spike-Chunsoft developed and published game, "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward" as a map for Garry's Mod - particularly for use in the Jailbreak gamemode.

The core geometry of the map is **designed to replicate the game's original artistic intent and design**; though we have opted to add, remove, or modify features and locations to make the map ultimately better suited for the Jailbreak gamemode.

## Map Features

- Support for up to 32 prisoners.
- Fully featured and designed two story prison map based on the "Rhizome 9" location from Virtue's Last Reward.

## Project Directory Structure

- **\audio\路** - This folder is for the project's remixed music files based on the game's original soundtrack.

- **\game_info\路** - This folder contains graphics and information designed to help give you background knowledge of the game for the purposes of the project. There are to be NO MAJOR SPOILERS in this folder.
